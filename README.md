# 2024 Hackathon Toronto Road Safety Competition
Analyzed cyclist collisions and provided Toronto Police Service with safety suggestion in 2024 SAS Hackathon 

## Project Overview
▪ Data Analysis: Statistical & Time-series & Geographical analysis

▪ Analytics Tool: Python, Tableau, SAS

▪ Data: Traffic Collisions, Cycling Networks, Killed or Seriously Injured Data (Source: Toronto City Open Data)

▪ Achievement: Champion honor achieved from SAS institute, and Toronto Police Service

## Business Problem

Since the onset of the pandemic, the number of bicycle-related collisions has steadily increased, while total collision rates have declined by 15% between 2019 and 2023.

The cycling collision injury rate is significantly higher at 68%, compared to lower injury rates for automotive/motorcycle collisions, which stand at below 12%.

## Data Analysis : Key Findings

### Why do collisions happen?

1) Traffic control
- The primary reason for bicycle collisions is lack of control

2) Lack of connectivity between cycling networks
- Bicycle collisions mainly occurred horizontally aligned with Cycle Track
- The vertical and horizontal tracks are not well intersected

## Solution: Recommendation
Proposed improvements to cycle tracks, traffic controls, and information sharing to cyclists  =
1) Improve cycle tracks on seven streets

2) Install traffic lights at specific intersections

3) Improve Information sharing with an app :recommendation the safest routes based on traffic collision data
