# 2024 Hackathon Toronto Road Safety Competition


## Project Overview

2024 SAS Hackathon was hosted by SAS institute and Toronto Police Service(TPS) in March 2024.
Analyzed cyclist collisions and provided Toronto Police Service with safety suggestion in 2024 SAS Hackathon.

▪ Data Analysis: Statistical & Time-series & Geographical analysis

▪ Analytics Tool: Python, Tableau, SAS

▪ Data: Traffic Collisions, Cycling Networks, Killed or Seriously Injured Data (Source: Toronto City Open Data)

▪ Achievement: Champion honor achieved from SAS institute, and Toronto Police Service

## Business Problem

Since the onset of the pandemic, the number of bicycle-related collisions has steadily increased, while total collision rates have declined by 15% between 2019 and 2023.

The cycling collision injury rate is significantly higher at 75%, compared to lower injury rates for automotive/motorcycle collisions, which stand at below 12%.

## Data Analysis : Key Findings

### Why do collisions happen?

#### 1. Traffic control
- The primary reason for bicycle collisions is lack of control

#### 2. Lack of connectivity between cycling networks
- Bicycle collisions mainly occurred horizontally aligned with Cycle Track
- The vertical and horizontal tracks are not well intersected

## Solution: Recommendation

### 1) Improve cycle tracks on seven streets

Improve cyclist safety with seamless integration between cycling lanes

### 2) Install traffic lights at specific intersections

Increase traffic control in areas with high numbers of “no traffic control” collisions

### 3) Improve Information sharing with an app 
recommendation the safest routes based on traffic collision data
